\begin{abstract}

The recent appearance of the \textit{RISC-V} ISA opened many exciting possibilities for building processor-based systems without the need to license the base architecture from providers like Arm Holdings (Arm Â®). Running applications on bare metal \textit{RISC-V} machines is a good starting point, but an OS is required to ease the developers' efforts for more complex applications. Linux is a well-polished OS since people have been using it for over three decades. The problem is that open-source SoC platform solutions that run Linux and simultaneously are modular and configurable do not exist. This work aims to create an SoC capable of executing a Linux OS. The author based the work on \textit{IOb-SoC}, a modular and configurable open-source SoC platform that only runs bare-metal applications. This project achieves its goals by changing the \textit{IOb-SoC} CPU and adding three hardware peripherals. Additionally, the author develops software solutions that improve the \textit{IOb-SoC} platform, complement the hardware components created and allow the execution of a complete OS in the new SoC. Throughout this work, the thesis might refer to the SoC developed as \textit{IOb-SoC-Linux}. The \textit{IOb-SoC-Linux} uses less than 10\% of the FPGA resources on the supported development boards. Moreover, the Linux OS boots in five seconds in the Kintex Ultrascale and seven seconds in the Cyclone V.
