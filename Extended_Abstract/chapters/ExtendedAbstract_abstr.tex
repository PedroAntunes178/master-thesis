\begin{abstract}

The recent appearance of the \textit{RISC-V} ISA opened many exciting possibilities for building processor-based systems without the need to license the base architecture from providers like Arm Holdings (Arm Â®). Running applications on bare metal \textit{RISC-V} machines is a good starting point, but an OS is required to ease the developers' efforts for more complex applications. Linux is a well-polished OS since people have been using it for over three decades. The problem is that open-source SoC platform solutions that run Linux and simultaneously are modular and configurable do not exist. This work aims to create an SoC capable of executing a Linux OS. The author based the work on \textit{IOb-SoC}, a modular and configurable open-source SoC platform that only runs bare-metal applications. This project achieves its goals by changing the \textit{IOb-SoC} CPU and adding three hardware peripherals. Additionally, the author develops software solutions that improve the \textit{IOb-SoC} platform, complement the hardware components created and enhance the hardware to allow the execution of a complete OS in a new SoC called \textit{IOb-SoC-Linux}. The size of \textit{IOb-SoC-Linux} is only marginally above that of the original \textit{IOb-SoC} and can run in most low-cost FPGAs. The Linux OS takes four minutes and thirty seconds to build. The kernel boots in a \textit{Kintex Ultrascale} device in five seconds and in seven seconds in a \textit{Cyclone V} device. The work developed in this thesis met all the project's goals and went beyond them.
