% Summarize the problem
The recent appearance of the \textit{RISC-V} \acrshort{isa} opened many exciting possibilities for building processor-based systems without the need to license the base architecture from providers like Arm Holdings (Arm Â®). Running applications on bare metal \textit{RISC-V} machines is a good starting point, but an \acrshort{os} is required to ease the developers' efforts for more complex applications. Linux is a well-polished \acrshort{os} since it has been used for over three decades. The problem is that open-source \acrshort{soc} platform solutions that run Linux and simultaneously are modular and configurable do not exist.
% Solution found
This work aims to create an \acrshort{soc} capable of executing a Linux \acrshort{os}. The author based the work on \textit{IOb-SoC}, a modular and configurable open-source \acrshort{soc} platform that only runs bare-metal applications. This project achieves its goals by changing the \textit{IOb-SoC} \acrshort{cpu} and adding three hardware peripherals. Additionally, the author develops software solutions that improve the \textit{IOb-SoC} platform, complement the hardware components created and allow the execution of a complete \acrshort{os} in the new \acrshort{soc}. Throughout this work, the thesis might refer to the \acrshort{soc} developed as \textit{IOb-SoC-Linux}.
% Results
Moreover, the \textit{IOb-SoC-Linux} uses less than 10\% of the \acrshort{fpga} resources on the supported development boards. A Linux OS takes four minutes and thirty seconds to build. The Linux \acrshort{os} boots in five seconds in the \textit{Kintex Ultrascale} and seven seconds in the \textit{Cyclone V}. Therefore, the work developed in this thesis successfully achieved the project's goals.
